## ℹ️ About

**Machine-Learning-Practice** is your interactive toolkit to master foundational ML techniques—from simple linear regression to advanced ensemble methods. Each Jupyter notebook walks you through data loading (in `Inputs/`), feature engineering, model training (in `Models/`), performance evaluation, and saving outputs (in `Outputs/`). Ideal for learners, instructors, and practitioners refining their skills.

## ⚙️ Usage

- **Explore Notebooks**  
  Launch any `.ipynb` to step through code, visualizations, and explanations:  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook 01_LinearRegressionSingleVariable.ipynb
  ```

- **Run Models Programmatically**  
  Import saved models from `Models/` and make predictions:  
  ```python
  import joblib
  model = joblib.load("Models/random_forest.pkl")
  preds = model.predict(X_new)
  ```

- **Output Artifacts**  
  Find evaluation reports, charts, and logs in the `Outputs/` folder after running each notebook.
